     <p>Hi Lisa, Our 3rd presentation could have been a lot better, and could have been completeled in a more timely fashion. Everyones schedules are so crazy that it's so hard to find time for everyone to meet. The issue is when we do meet, a lot of the group are too scared to say anything, and I still feel like even though I'm not leading the project I still have to tell everyone what to do or else they don't do anything at all. Mike has been working hard and communicating even though his schedule is crazier than most, and brent has at least been responsive. The other group members help with what they can but are mostly quiet and keep to themselves until its presentation time.</p>

	  <p>Have a nice weekend!</p>
