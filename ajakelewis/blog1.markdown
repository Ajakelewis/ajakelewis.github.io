      <h5> Sep 6, 2020</h5>
	  
      <p>This week was pretty laid back, still trying to get my head in the game of online school. This is a huge change and I really didn't think it would turn out like this.
		I really hope that it doesn't carry over into the spring semester, I've never graduated on stage for anything in the past and my whole family was looking forward to finally have the oppurtunity to see it happen.</p>
		
		<p>I had a busy work week and haven't had too much time to play around with the design of the blog. I'll try to free up some time to make it a little prettier, maybe add a backround or something and just update all the pages with it. 
		We're doing something similar that helps with learning how to build and improve these pages in CIT384. Essentially we're just building off the last thing we finished and using it as a base for the next homework and continually improving this site we're building.<p>
	  </p>
	  
	  <p> There wasn't too much exciting stuff aside from that, my birthdays coming up on a week so I've got to see how I can make the best of that with everything going on. I go out to a nice dinner, but finding anything thats actually open is impossible nowadays. </p>
	  
	  <br>
	  <p>Have a nice weekend!</p>
