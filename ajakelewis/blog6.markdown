      <h5> Oct 12, 2020</h5>
     
      <p>This week in my classes, I started work on a resume website for CIT384, its multi part with some of it already turned in and the parts I'm building on from what I already turned in due tomorrow. 
	  More Geology labs done, I've developed a formula for writing these papers so it has made my life a lot easier and freed up some time for me. </p>
	  <p> I've had time to take a look at the ansible playbook lab and will start getting to work on that ASAP, it looks pretty short and straightforward so I'm hoping it will be a piece of cake. </p>
	  <p> In better news, I was finally able to get that Nvidia graphics card that I was talking about, It wasn't the exact one that I wanted, but at this point beggers can't be choosers. Happy to have gotten what, I got, and I'm excited to be abnle to play games on a higher level!</p>
	  <br>
	  <p>Have a nice weekend!</p>
