      <h5>Oct 27, 2020</h5>
     
      <p>This week has definitely been one of the better ones of the semester. I was able to get a lot of things done early on, and it finally gave me time to come up for air. 
	  Halloween is also this week, and although I won't be able to see my friends or go out, I get to play horror games with my friends online and it's probably just as much fun and a lot safer.
	  By the sound of the news things are getting worse again, but it could also have something to do with the election coming up. It should be an interesting couple of weeks, but I'm super happy that we are entering the close of this year.
	  </p>
	  <p> I've learned a lot about css and html from 384, I think I've heard a few people talking down on it but it's definitely been helpful in putting together these little websites and understanding how they work and how the should be structured. 
	  I'm going to try to implement some changes from what I've learned there to this blog, I haven't had too much time, but since things are better than they have been I'll make time to play around with it. 
	  I changed the github name below to link to my profile now as a start, as well as making the CSUN logo look a little better and will update it in the next blog as I add the changes.</p>
	  <br>
	  <p>Have a nice weekend!</p>
