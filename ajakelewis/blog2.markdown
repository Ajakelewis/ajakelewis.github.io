      <h5> Sep 14, 2020</h5>
     
      <p>This week in my classes finally started feeling like a real semester, the homework is coming in presentations are being assigned.
	  The transition to online classes is still tough, but I'm slowly getting used to it. It's kind of easier this way for some classes, but It's so much harder for my geology classes since we can't see or feel anything.
	  I feel like it's a pretty sweet deal for most other teachers though, since we're all on computers already its almost easier to be able to get work done and follow along as teachers give the lecture.
	 </p>
	 <p>I've had to select teams for final projects this week and present a HW website to the class. In 384 we're using a website called glitch, and it makes creating and building off of websites for assignments really easy.
	 It also could be good for collaborative projects, but so far we haven't had any opportunities to. 
	 From their web page "Whether youâ€™re learning how to code or building a production-level app, find out how Glitch can power your next idea."
	  <br>
	  <p>Have a nice weekend!</p>
