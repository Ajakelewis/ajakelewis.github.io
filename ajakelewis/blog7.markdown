      <h5> Oct 18, 2020</h5>
	  
      <p>I keep on forgetting that I need to submit the link after I finish editing and I've missed like 3 blogs so far. I need to get on top of it, something about pushing the updated folder makes me feel like I turned it in.</p>
	  <p>This was one of my hardest weeks for all my classes so far, and I thought it was going to get a lot easier after the 425 presentation. 
	  These Geology lab reports are killer, it makes it so hard for me to get anything else done while I'm working on them. This in a addition to work have been a nightmare, but I'm still powering through it so we're gonna make it. 
	  <p> I updated the navigation to include all of the pages that their are going to be, I haven't exactly figured out how to remove the ajakelewis.github.io from the top so I guess I'll leave it for now.</p> 
	  <p> We finished and presented our first project in CIT384 and I was able to snah 100% on it, but we're already getting started and choosing parts for the next one. It's first come first serve on topics so I'm gonna try to figure out mine ASAP.</p>

	  <p>Have a nice weekend!</p>
