      <h5> Oct 4, 2020</h5>
     
      <p>This week was a mountain but I think we're on the way back down now. We gave our first (and I think final) presentation for CIT425 as the first group to present. 
	  We did the presentation on botnet, and based on what Kaplan said we killed it. The presentation was 30 minutes, but we were able to kill a lot of time with a live demo I created of an example botnet web panel. </p>
	  <p> It was a lot of work along with everything else I have to do, but I guess it's really nice to know that at least that is out of the way and a portion of my grade is secure. That project took up a ton of time and I'm glad its over. 
	  My other classes have been a little bit better, but all the work keeps being due at the same time so there ends of being periods of nothing, then periods of extreme rushing. I have lab 2 for this class that I'm finishing up, the dockerfile is working I just want to make sure it looks nice and is done in the most efficient way possible. </p>
	  <br>
	  <p>Have a nice weekend!</p>
