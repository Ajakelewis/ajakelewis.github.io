      <p>This is the first blog for our CIT 480 class, and my first experience using github to build a website. 
	  As the weeks progress I will work out a more visually appealing theme, I just wanted to get the base site functioning before the first blog was due. 
	  
	  It wasn't too hard to set up, and relearning about HTML from my CIT 384 class that I'm taking right now as well really helps!</p>
